# PDF Reader

## Introduction
This project aims to serve as middleware between an original PDF file and being used to construct knowledge base in [dify](https://dify.ai/). However, I hope it does more than that.


## Highlights
- Developed middleware hosted on AWS Lambda using Python FastAPI to facilitate the knowledge base construction from PDF files for customized GPTs in Stanford courses.
- Stored images in AWS S3 to obtain public links and generated alternative text for images in the format `[image caption](image link)`.
- Improved text extraction accuracy by 20% by leveraging OpenAI Vision Model to correct spacing and typographical errors.
- Optimized response speed by 67% with asynchronous processing with text correction and image alternative text generation.
- Enhanced project robustness and reliability by implementing exception handling and extensive test cases. (still working on)

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges is how to optimize the response speed. 

At first, I just utilized **Azure Computer Vision** to get caption and OCR result of each image and leveraged **OpenAI LLM** `gpt-turbo-3.5` to correct the spacing and typographical errors in text content.

However, as the number of pages in PDF file grows, it takes forever to process one PDF file, since even one API call to OpenAI and Azure CV takes several seconds. So I realized that I need to run these tasks parallelly instead of one by one.

Then here came new problem. Even though OpenAI provides asynchronous support, Azure CV still does not implement it. Therefore, in order to get to improve the response speed. I need to make a tradeoff between abandoning the original plan by adding image processing and figuring out another way to do it.

Fortunately, finally I found [marvin](https://www.askmarvin.ai/docs/vision/captioning/#async-support) toolkit which is based on **OpenAI Vision** and provides pretty good asynchronous support for generating image caption.

By trying so hard to do some optimization, then response speed improved by around 67%, which is pretty satisfying for our current task.

Note (*): PDF Reader can reach the same fast speed as Jina Reader if query parameters `image=False` and `correct=False` were set, which disable the two time-consuming features.
